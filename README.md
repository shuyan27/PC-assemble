## Reflection
In this lab, I had learn how to assemble CPU which helps me to assemble my own CPU in the future. The activity enhanced my familiarity with essential CPU hardware components, including RAM, CPU, SSD, Power Supply, Motherboard, and Cables. This knowledge is fundamental for anyone interested in understanding computer architecture. 

Improvement: 
I think this activity should do individually so that all students can engage into this activity and make sure all of us learn more about it. As only some students engaging themselves during the group section assemble. 

Opinions: 
The CPU hardware assembly activity was a valuable learning experience that demystified the intricate process of building a computer's central processing unit. The hands-on nature of the activity allowed for a practical understanding of the components' physical placement and the logical sequence in which they come together. This activity is highly recommended for individuals seeking a foundational understanding of computer hardware assembly.

In conclusion, the activity successfully combined theoretical knowledge with practical application, providing a holistic learning experience. The incorporation of improvement suggestions could further enhance the effectiveness of this learning activity, making it even more accessible and engaging for participants with varying learning styles.
